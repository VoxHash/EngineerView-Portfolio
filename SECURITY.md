- **Security advisory** published after the fix is released

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your dependencies
- **Use environment variables**: Never commit API keys or secrets
- **Enable security features**: Use HTTPS, security headers, etc.
- **Regular backups**: Keep regular backups of your data
- **Monitor logs**: Watch for suspicious activity

### For Developers

- **Code review**: All code changes are reviewed for security issues
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Output encoding**: All outputs are properly encoded
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication and session management
- **Authorization**: Proper access controls and permissions

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications use HTTPS
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of all outputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection
- **XSS Prevention**: Cross-Site Scripting prevention
